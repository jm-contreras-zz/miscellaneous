**Repository of various standalone scripts.**

- ***monty_hall_simulator.py*** runs simulations of the [Monty Hall Problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem), allowing the user to specify the number of simulations to run and the game strategy to adopt (switch guesses or not). The user can also change the number of doors in the game.

- ***num2log.R*** contains a function that takes as input a data frame with numeric or mixed variables. It identifies the variables that can be converted to logical type (i.e., only values 0, 1, and NA) and converts them accordingly.
