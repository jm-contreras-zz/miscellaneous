- ***monty_hall_simulator.py*** runs simulations of the [Monty Hall Problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem), allowing the user to specify the number of simulations to run and the game strategy to adopt (switch guesses or not). The user can also change the number of doors in the game.
